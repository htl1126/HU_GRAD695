## Introduction

With the income data, I would like to know whether male workers have more income than female workers for all industries on average.

## Analysis

Firstly we take an overview of the data.

```{r}
rawdata = read.csv('income.csv')
summary(rawdata)
```

Remove all the rows having 'NA'.

```{r}
data = rawdata[rowSums(is.na(rawdata[ , 2:8])) == 0, ]
```
